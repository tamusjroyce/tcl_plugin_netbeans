Netbeans Tcl Plugin - Source Code

http://plugins.netbeans.org/plugin/39119/tcl-plugin -> http://chiselapp.com/user/wiede/repository/netbeanstcl/index

This fixes a bug with windows. Ported to github, as the original code looks to be unsupported. It was written as-of 2011. But the plug-in still works pretty good.

A huge thanks to the work Micha≈Ç Poczwardowski, Google Summer of Code, and all others involved!
