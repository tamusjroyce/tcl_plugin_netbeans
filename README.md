Netbeans Tcl Plugin - Source Code

This fixes a bug with windows. Ported to github, as the original code looks to be unsupported. It was written as-of 2011. But the plug-in still works pretty good. It is quite impressive!

A huge thanks to the work Michał Poczwardowski, Google Summer of Code, and all others involved!
